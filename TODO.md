## TODO

* Initialize the database state in the beginning of test runs, before running a single test. Use Docker for this.
* Read library version to Gradle build from `org.aurinkopg.GlobalConstants.LIBRARY_VERSION`.
* Check that the PostgreSQL user used has superuser privileges.
* Test the Docker workflows.
* Create a database for Aurinko metadata so that snapshots can be tracked.
* Test with Java 9.
* Upload to some public Maven repository.
* Write some simple usage instructions.
* Create a Continuous Integration setup (Travis?)
