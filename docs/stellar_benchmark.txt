    Use Stellar instead of Flyway.

    This is even slower than with Flyway:

    Time spent doing database initialization in NotificationServiceEditIntegrationSpec:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Execution #1 of 'initializeDatabase' took 2535 ms.
    Execution #2 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1884 ms.
    Execution #3 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1896 ms.
    Execution #4 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1967 ms.
    Execution #5 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1944 ms.
    Execution #6 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1865 ms.
    Execution #7 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1924 ms.
    Execution #8 of 'initializeDatabase' took 2023 ms.
    Execution #9 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1791 ms.
    Execution #10 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1859 ms.
    Execution #11 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1824 ms.
    Execution #12 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1893 ms.
    Execution #13 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1928 ms.
    Execution #14 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1864 ms.
    Execution #15 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1879 ms.
    Execution #16 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1946 ms.
    Execution #17 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1851 ms.
    Execution #18 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1879 ms.
    Execution #19 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1996 ms.
    Execution #20 of 'initializeDatabase' took 1842 ms.
    TOTAL: 20 executions of 'initializeDatabase' took 38590 ms.

    So this is about 3 times slower than the previous Flyway-based solution.

    All hope is not lost, however. I suspect that most of the time that
    calls to Stellar take is spent on the overhead of issuing a shell
    command from Scala. Also:
    - Stellar has to parse its own configuration file (stellar.yaml) every time.
    - Stellar is written in Python, which is not a very fast language.
    - Because Stellar drops and re-creates the whole database every time we
    run it, we have to call `DBs.closeAll()` and `DBs.setupAll()` before
    every test. With Flyway we had to do it only once, in `beforeAll()`.

    I think that Stellar's basic idea is very promising. If we didn't
    have to cross so many language boundaries (JVM -> Shell -> Python),
    this could be very fast. I must think about this a little more.
